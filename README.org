Several general and customizable find/replace scripts similar to sed/awk/grep.

In perl, python. 

Features:

- Multiple find/replace pairs.
- with regex or literal replacement.
- work on list of files or all files in a directory or sub-directory.
- Can specify a range of depth level of a directory.

To use, open the script, and edit the input path, and other parameters. These script do not use command line args by design. This might change in the future.
